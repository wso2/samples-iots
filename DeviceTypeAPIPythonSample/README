Docs :- https://docs.wso2.com/display/IoTS310/Creating+a+Fire+Alarm+Device+Type+via+the+Console

SampleClient :- 
Connects with the initial token which has a validity period of 1hr. 
Will not work if disconnetcs and connects again after token expired.
If client maintains the connection continously, It will continue to be connected even after 1hr

SampleClient2 :- 
Take new access token each time it begins the execution. 
So token expiration not be an issue
